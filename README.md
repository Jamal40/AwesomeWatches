# AwesomeWatches

## Overview
AwesomeWatches is a simple e-commerce app. In which the user can add items to the cart and view the cart items. An see how much the items cost in total. 
The project has another division, which is the admin pages. In these pages the admins need to be authorized, so that they can manipulate the items data.
The project utilizes 2 major ASP web apps models(ASP MVC and ASP Razor Pages).

## Built With:

### Framework:
.Net6: ASP.Net Core was used to buid the application(MVC & Razor Pages).

### Database:
The database that has been used is SQLServer and EFCore to access it. I intended to add some relations like many to many, one to many and one to one.
Some may have simpler models, but I wanted to explore EfCore more.

### UI:
The default CSS library used by ASP is bootstrap, however I removed it and used Materialize instead. It was very cool experience.
Pixlr to edit images and logos. 

## Getting Started:
 - Download/clone the project.  
 - Edit the connection string of the databes in appsettings.json file.
 - Update-Database. 
 - Run the project.
